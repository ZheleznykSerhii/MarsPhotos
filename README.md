The task was:

Please develop a one-page website which helps people to explore NASA`s expeditions to Mars. The website should provide an ability for the user to select a Rover(Curiosity, Opportunity, Spirit), Camera(Front, Rear, …) and Sol(Mars day). After the Rover, Camere and Sol were selected, the website should show the images were done by the Rover. It might be a big number of images for each Sol(Mars day) so the app should have a pagination. The pagination should be implemented in a way “Load more…” button. 
Using material design, please make sure that the website is pretty as much as possible as this test task is for the front-end where look and feel play a huge role.
